  - heading: Hand Menu
    text: The BeamXR Hand Menu is a simple hand mechanism for opening and closing
      the Control Panel, straight from the player's hands or controller. You will
      need to assign your controller and/or hand transforms to it so they can be
      followed. This can be easily debugged in play mode to ensure the correct positioning
      and rotations.
